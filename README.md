PodSalsa is a simple web application that displays only information about the release version of the application, the Git commit and the build date.
The goal of this project is to provide a simple example of a Go application with workflows for building and releasing the application in a secure way.

More documentation will follow soon.

## Work in Progress üèóÔ∏è

- [ ] Implement the release workflow for sbom, docker images, code scanning, and signing
- [ ] Document the release workflows
- [ ] Document Security Policy (Verifying the release artifacts)
- [ ] Improve the application (more configuration option, better UI, scaling use-case)
